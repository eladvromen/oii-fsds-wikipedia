Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<ref name="":7"" />

After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 [[C.&nbsp;F. Jeff Wu]] again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf |title=Statistics=Data Science? |last=Wu |first=C.&nbsp;F.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=James |first1=Gareth |author1-link=Gareth M. James |last2=Witten|first2=Daniela| author2-link=Daniela Witten |last3=Hastie |first3=Trevor |author3-link=Trevor Hastie |last4=Tibshirani |first4=Robert | author4-link=Robert Tibshirani |date=2017-09-29 |publisher=Springer |language=en}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 [[C.&nbsp;F. Jeff Wu]] again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf |title=Statistics=Data Science? |last=Wu |first=C.&nbsp;F.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=James |first1=Gareth |author1-link=Gareth M. James |last2=Witten|first2=Daniela| author2-link=Daniela Witten |last3=Hastie |first3=Trevor |author3-link=Trevor Hastie |last4=Tibshirani |first4=Robert | author4-link=Robert Tibshirani |date=2017-09-29 |publisher=Springer |language=en}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<ref name="":7"" />

== Etymology ==

=== Early usage ===
In 1962, [[John Tukey]] described a field he called ""[[data analysis]]"", which resembles modern data science.<ref name="":7"">{{Cite web |url=http://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf |title=50 years of Data Science |last=Donoho |first=David |date=18 September 2015 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> In 1985, in a lecture given to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, [[C.&nbsp;F.

The term ""data science"" has been traced back to 1974, when [[Peter Naur]] proposed it as an alternative name to computer science.<ref name="":2"" /> In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.<ref name="":2"" /> However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 [[C.&nbsp;F. Jeff Wu]] again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf |title=Statistics=Data Science? |last=Wu |first=C.&nbsp;F.

During the 1990s, popular terms for the process of finding patterns in datasets (which were increasingly large) included ""knowledge discovery"" and ""[[data mining]]"".<ref name="":2"" /><ref name="":1"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/05/28/a-very-short-history-of-data-science/ |title=A Very Short History of Data Science |last=Press |first=Gil |website=Forbes |language=en |access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>

[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=James |first1=Gareth |author1-link=Gareth M. James |last2=Witten|first2=Daniela| author2-link=Daniela Witten |last3=Hastie |first3=Trevor |author3-link=Trevor Hastie |last4=Tibshirani |first4=Robert | author4-link=Robert Tibshirani |date=2017-09-29 |publisher=Springer |language=en}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=James |first1=Gareth |author1-link=Gareth M. James |last2=Witten|first2=Daniela| author2-link=Daniela Witten |last3=Hastie |first3=Trevor |author3-link=Trevor Hastie |last4=Tibshirani |first4=Robert | author4-link=Robert Tibshirani |date=2017-09-29 |publisher=Springer |language=en}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=James |first1=Gareth |author1-link=Gareth M. James |last2=Witten|first2=Daniela| author2-link=Daniela Witten |last3=Hastie |first3=Trevor |author3-link=Trevor Hastie |last4=Tibshirani |first4=Robert | author4-link=Robert Tibshirani |date=2017-09-29 |publisher=Springer |language=en}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=James |first1=Gareth |author1-link=Gareth M. James |last2=Witten|first2=Daniela| author2-link=Daniela Witten |last3=Hastie |first3=Trevor |author3-link=Trevor Hastie |last4=Tibshirani |first4=Robert | author4-link=Robert Tibshirani |date=2017-09-29 |publisher=Springer |language=en}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<ref name="":7"" />

== Etymology ==

=== Early usage ===
In 1962, [[John Tukey]] described a field he called ""[[data analysis]]"", which resembles modern data science.<ref name="":7"">{{Cite web |url=http://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf |title=50 years of Data Science |last=Donoho |first=David |date=18 September 2015 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> In 1985, in a lecture given to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, [[C.&nbsp;F.

The term ""data science"" has been traced back to 1974, when [[Peter Naur]] proposed it as an alternative name to computer science.<ref name="":2"" /> In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.<ref name="":2"" /> However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 [[C.&nbsp;F. Jeff Wu]] again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf |title=Statistics=Data Science? |last=Wu |first=C.&nbsp;F.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=James |first1=Gareth |author1-link=Gareth M. James |last2=Witten|first2=Daniela| author2-link=Daniela Witten |last3=Hastie |first3=Trevor |author3-link=Trevor Hastie |last4=Tibshirani |first4=Robert | author4-link=Robert Tibshirani |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<ref name="":7"" />

After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 [[C.&nbsp;F. Jeff Wu]] again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf |title=Statistics=Data Science? |last=Wu |first=C.&nbsp;F.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<ref name="":7"" />

After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 [[C.&nbsp;F. Jeff Wu]] again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf |title=Statistics=Data Science? |last=Wu |first=C.&nbsp;F.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<ref name="":7"" />

The term ""data science"" has been traced back to 1974, when [[Peter Naur]] proposed it as an alternative name to computer science.<ref name="":2"" /> In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.<ref name="":2"" /> However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 [[C.&nbsp;F. Jeff Wu]] again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf |title=Statistics=Data Science? |last=Wu |first=C.&nbsp;F.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<ref name="":7"" />

The term ""data science"" has been traced back to 1974, when [[Peter Naur]] proposed it as an alternative name to computer science.<ref name="":2"" /> In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.<ref name="":2"" /> However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 [[C.&nbsp;F. Jeff Wu]] again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf |title=Statistics=Data Science? |last=Wu |first=C.&nbsp;F.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

=== Relationship to statistics ===
Many statisticians, including [[Nate Silver]], have argued that data science is not a new field, but rather another name for statistics.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.statisticsviews.com/article/nate-silver-what-i-need-from-statisticians/ |title=Nate Silver: What I need from statisticians |website=Statistics Views |date=23 August 2013 |access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Others argue that data science is distinct from statistics because it focuses on problems and techniques unique to digital data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://priceonomics.com/whats-the-difference-between-data-science-and/ |title=What's the Difference Between Data Science and Statistics? |website=Priceonomics |date=13 October 2015 |language=en |access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> [[Vasant Dhar]] writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description. In contrast, data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e.g., from images, text, sensors, transactions, customer information, etc.) and emphasizes prediction and action.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Vasant Dhar |date=2013-12-01 |title=Data science and prediction |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=56 |issue=12 |pages=64â€“73 |language=en |doi=10.1145/2500499 |s2cid=6107147|url=http://archive.nyu.edu/handle/2451/31553 }}</ref> [[Andrew Gelman]] of [[Columbia University]] has described statistics as a non-essential part of data science.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2013/11/14/statistics-least-important-part-data-science/ |title=Statistics is the least important part of data science Â« Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science |website=statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu |access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>

Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<ref name="":7"" />

The term ""data science"" has been traced back to 1974, when [[Peter Naur]] proposed it as an alternative name to computer science.<ref name="":2"" /> In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.<ref name="":2"" /> However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 [[C.&nbsp;F. Jeff Wu]] again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf |title=Statistics=Data Science? |last=Wu |first=C.&nbsp;F.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<ref name="":7"" />

After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 [[C.&nbsp;F. Jeff Wu]] again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf |title=Statistics=Data Science? |last=Wu |first=C.&nbsp;F.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<ref name="":7"" />

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

Moreover, the growing importance of data privacy and security is creating additional demand for data scientists who can ensure that data is handled responsibly and in compliance with regulations. As data becomes an increasingly valuable asset, organizations are investing in data science teams to protect and maximize the value of their data.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-08-05 |title=are data science jobs in demand? |url=https://bitaacademy.com/are-data-science-jobs-in-demand/ |access-date=2024-08-05 |website=bitaacademy.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

=== Relationship to statistics ===
Many statisticians, including [[Nate Silver]], have argued that data science is not a new field, but rather another name for statistics.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.statisticsviews.com/article/nate-silver-what-i-need-from-statisticians/ |title=Nate Silver: What I need from statisticians |website=Statistics Views |date=23 August 2013 |access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Others argue that data science is distinct from statistics because it focuses on problems and techniques unique to digital data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://priceonomics.com/whats-the-difference-between-data-science-and/ |title=What's the Difference Between Data Science and Statistics? |website=Priceonomics |date=13 October 2015 |language=en |access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> [[Vasant Dhar]] writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description.

Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<ref name="":7"" />

== Etymology ==

=== Early usage ===
In 1962, [[John Tukey]] described a field he called ""[[data analysis]]"", which resembles modern data science.<ref name="":7"">{{Cite web |url=http://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf |title=50 years of Data Science |last=Donoho |first=David |date=18 September 2015 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> In 1985, in a lecture given to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, [[C.&nbsp;F.

The term ""data science"" has been traced back to 1974, when [[Peter Naur]] proposed it as an alternative name to computer science.<ref name="":2"" /> In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.<ref name="":2"" /> However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 [[C.&nbsp;F. Jeff Wu]] again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf |title=Statistics=Data Science? |last=Wu |first=C.&nbsp;F.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<ref name="":7"" />

The term ""data science"" has been traced back to 1974, when [[Peter Naur]] proposed it as an alternative name to computer science.<ref name="":2"" /> In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.<ref name="":2"" /> However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 [[C.&nbsp;F. Jeff Wu]] again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf |title=Statistics=Data Science? |last=Wu |first=C.&nbsp;F.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<ref name="":7"" />

== Etymology ==

=== Early usage ===
In 1962, [[John Tukey]] described a field he called ""[[data analysis]]"", which resembles modern data science.<ref name="":7"">{{Cite web |url=http://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf |title=50 years of Data Science |last=Donoho |first=David |date=18 September 2015 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> In 1985, in a lecture given to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, [[C.&nbsp;F.

The term ""data science"" has been traced back to 1974, when [[Peter Naur]] proposed it as an alternative name to computer science.<ref name="":2"" /> In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.<ref name="":2"" /> However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 [[C.&nbsp;F. Jeff Wu]] again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf |title=Statistics=Data Science? |last=Wu |first=C.&nbsp;F.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<ref name="":7"" />

The term ""data science"" has been traced back to 1974, when [[Peter Naur]] proposed it as an alternative name to computer science.<ref name="":2"" /> In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.<ref name="":2"" /> However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 [[C.&nbsp;F. Jeff Wu]] again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf |title=Statistics=Data Science? |last=Wu |first=C.&nbsp;F.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

=== Relationship to statistics ===
Many statisticians, including [[Nate Silver]], have argued that data science is not a new field, but rather another name for statistics.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.statisticsviews.com/article/nate-silver-what-i-need-from-statisticians/ |title=Nate Silver: What I need from statisticians |website=Statistics Views |date=23 August 2013 |access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Others argue that data science is distinct from statistics because it focuses on problems and techniques unique to digital data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://priceonomics.com/whats-the-difference-between-data-science-and/ |title=What's the Difference Between Data Science and Statistics? |website=Priceonomics |date=13 October 2015 |language=en |access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> [[Vasant Dhar]] writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description. In contrast, data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e.g., from images, text, sensors, transactions, customer information, etc.) and emphasizes prediction and action.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Vasant Dhar |date=2013-12-01 |title=Data science and prediction |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=56 |issue=12 |pages=64â€“73 |language=en |doi=10.1145/2500499 |s2cid=6107147|url=http://archive.nyu.edu/handle/2451/31553 }}</ref> [[Andrew Gelman]] of [[Columbia University]] has described statistics as a non-essential part of data science.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2013/11/14/statistics-least-important-part-data-science/ |title=Statistics is the least important part of data science Â« Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science |website=statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu |access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>

Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<ref name="":7"" />

== Etymology ==

=== Early usage ===
In 1962, [[John Tukey]] described a field he called ""[[data analysis]]"", which resembles modern data science.<ref name="":7"">{{Cite web |url=http://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf |title=50 years of Data Science |last=Donoho |first=David |date=18 September 2015 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> In 1985, in a lecture given to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, [[C.&nbsp;F.

The term ""data science"" has been traced back to 1974, when [[Peter Naur]] proposed it as an alternative name to computer science.<ref name="":2"" /> In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.<ref name="":2"" /> However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 [[C.&nbsp;F. Jeff Wu]] again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf |title=Statistics=Data Science? |last=Wu |first=C.&nbsp;F.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

The Encyclopedia Britannica describes data science as the handling of big volumes of data with the purpose of finding hidden patterns which of great importance decision making.

The field involves several major steps such as data cleaning, data integration and statistical analysis of data to generate understandable form of information. Skills that data scientists use include machine learning and data visualization tools to analyze and understand big data to solve issues.

Data science is needed in software industry, in health care, in financial system, in marketing strategies, and even in engineering amongst others, achieving business optimization, customer satisfaction and innovation. The growing importance of big data can therefore be attributed to the fact that the society today revolves around information and knowledge.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Data {{!}} science {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/data-science |access-date=2024-07-24 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>

'''Big Data'''

Big data is defined as large volumes of data that process and analyze to make some patterns and trends that are unidentifiable commonly. Big data, as defined in Daniyar Sabitovâ€™s 2020 work, Problematics of Big Data Representation in Media, may be described in terms of volume, velocity, and variety. All these attributes are rather problematic to depict and analyze when the data is vast and when the task of media representation and interpretation is at stake.

Therefore, the adaptation of big data throughout many industries has had the impact of improving decision making and planning. It enables the analysis of a number of aspects and becomes highly helpful when it comes to understanding consumers, markets, and business operations. Nevertheless, in order to get the maximum effect out of big data, the latter is accompanied by certain problems, including the question of the data quality and the question of the ethical usage of the data.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Richterich |first=Annika |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/j.ctv5vddsw |title=The Big Data Agenda: Data Ethics and Critical Data Studies |date=2018-04-13 |publisher=University of Westminster Press |isbn=978-1-911534-73-0 |doi=10.2307/j.ctv5vddsw.5.}}</ref>

Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<ref name="":7"" />

== Etymology ==

=== Early usage ===
In 1962, [[John Tukey]] described a field he called ""[[data analysis]]"", which resembles modern data science.<ref name="":7"">{{Cite web |url=http://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf |title=50 years of Data Science |last=Donoho |first=David |date=18 September 2015 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> In 1985, in a lecture given to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, [[C.&nbsp;F.

The term ""data science"" has been traced back to 1974, when [[Peter Naur]] proposed it as an alternative name to computer science.<ref name="":2"" /> In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.<ref name="":2"" /> However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 [[C.&nbsp;F. Jeff Wu]] again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf |title=Statistics=Data Science? |last=Wu |first=C.&nbsp;F.

During the 1990s, popular terms for the process of finding patterns in datasets (which were increasingly large) included ""knowledge discovery"" and ""[[data mining]]"".<ref name="":2"" /><ref name="":1"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/05/28/a-very-short-history-of-data-science/ |title=A Very Short History of Data Science |last=Press |first=Gil |website=Forbes |language=en |access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

The Encyclopedia Britannica describes data science as the handling of big volumes of data with the purpose of finding hidden patterns which of great importance decision making.

The field involves several major steps such as data cleaning, data integration and statistical analysis of data to generate understandable form of information. Skills that data scientists use include machine learning and data visualization tools to analyze and understand big data to solve issues.

Data science is needed in software industry, in health care, in financial system, in marketing strategies, and even in engineering amongst others, achieving business optimization, customer satisfaction and innovation. The growing importance of big data can therefore be attributed to the fact that the society today revolves around information and knowledge.[https://www.britannica.com/technology/data-science]

'''Big Data'''

Big data is defined as large volumes of data that process and analyze to make some patterns and trends that are unidentifiable commonly. Big data, as defined in Daniyar Sabitovâ€™s 2020 work, Problematics of Big Data Representation in Media, may be described in terms of volume, velocity, and variety. All these attributes are rather problematic to depict and analyze when the data is vast and when the task of media representation and interpretation is at stake.

Therefore, the adaptation of big data throughout many industries has had the impact of improving decision making and planning. It enables the analysis of a number of aspects and becomes highly helpful when it comes to understanding consumers, markets, and business operations. Nevertheless, in order to get the maximum effect out of big data, the latter is accompanied by certain problems, including the question of the data quality and the question of the ethical usage of the data.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Richterich |first=Annika |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/j.ctv5vddsw |title=The Big Data Agenda: Data Ethics and Critical Data Studies |date=2018-04-13 |publisher=University of Westminster Press |isbn=978-1-911534-73-0 |doi=10.2307/j.ctv5vddsw.5.}}</ref>

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

'''Big Data'''

Big data is defined as large volumes of data that process and analyze to make some patterns and trends that are unidentifiable commonly. Big data, as defined in Daniyar Sabitovâ€™s 2020 work, Problematics of Big Data Representation in Media, may be described in terms of volume, velocity, and variety. All these attributes are rather problematic to depict and analyze when the data is vast and when the task of media representation and interpretation is at stake.

Therefore, the adaptation of big data throughout many industries has had the impact of improving decision making and planning. It enables the analysis of a number of aspects and becomes highly helpful when it comes to understanding consumers, markets, and business operations. Nevertheless, in order to get the maximum effect out of big data, the latter is accompanied by certain problems, including the question of the data quality and the question of the ethical usage of the data.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Richterich |first=Annika |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/j.ctv5vddsw |title=The Big Data Agenda: Data Ethics and Critical Data Studies |date=2018-04-13 |publisher=University of Westminster Press |isbn=978-1-911534-73-0 |doi=10.2307/j.ctv5vddsw.5.}}</ref>

Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<ref name="":7"" />

The term ""data science"" has been traced back to 1974, when [[Peter Naur]] proposed it as an alternative name to computer science.<ref name="":2"" /> In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.<ref name="":2"" /> However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 [[C.&nbsp;F. Jeff Wu]] again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf |title=Statistics=Data Science? |last=Wu |first=C.&nbsp;F.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.

=== Relationship to statistics ===
Many statisticians, including [[Nate Silver]], have argued that data science is not a new field, but rather another name for statistics.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.statisticsviews.com/article/nate-silver-what-i-need-from-statisticians/ |title=Nate Silver: What I need from statisticians |website=Statistics Views |date=23 August 2013 |access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Others argue that data science is distinct from statistics because it focuses on problems and techniques unique to digital data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://priceonomics.com/whats-the-difference-between-data-science-and/ |title=What's the Difference Between Data Science and Statistics? |website=Priceonomics |date=13 October 2015 |language=en |access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> [[Vasant Dhar]] writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description.

Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<ref name="":7"" />

The term ""data science"" has been traced back to 1974, when [[Peter Naur]] proposed it as an alternative name to computer science.<ref name="":2"" /> In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.<ref name="":2"" /> However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 [[C.&nbsp;F. Jeff Wu]] again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf |title=Statistics=Data Science? |last=Wu |first=C.&nbsp;F.

==Data science and data analysis==
[[File:EDA example - Always plot your data.jpg|alt=summary statistics and scatterplots showing the Datasaurus dozen data set|thumb|Example for the usefulness of [[exploratory data analysis]] as demonstrated using the [[Datasaurus dozen]] data set]]
Data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of [[data management]] and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an [[interdisciplinary field]] that involves the application of statistical, computational, and [[machine learning]] methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354866394|title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. |last1=Gareth  |first1=Hastie |date=2017-09-29 |website=Springer |language=en|last2=Witten |first2=Tibshira}}</ref><ref name="":9"">{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438799|title=Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. |last1=Provost |first1=Foster |date=2013-08-01 |website=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |language=en|last2=Tom Fawcett }}</ref>

Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as [[data cleaning]], [[data visualization]], and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between [[variable (research)|variables]]. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a [[data analyst]] might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.<ref name="":8"" />

Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and [[iterative]] process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with [[unstructured data]] such as text or images and use [[machine learning]] algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to [[statistical analysis]], data science often involves tasks such as [[data preprocessing]], [[feature engineering]], and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using [[machine learning algorithms]] to predict user preferences.<ref name="":9"" /><ref name="":10"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814791/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques|title=Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. |last1=Han |first1=Kamber |date=2011 |language=en|last2=Pei |isbn=9780123814791 }}</ref>

While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, [[computer science]], and [[domain expertise]] to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.<ref name="":9"" />

Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, [[Computer programming|programming]], and [[data visualization]], as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from [[critical thinking]] and [[domain knowledge]], as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.<ref name="":8"" /><ref name="":9"" />

In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of [[data management]] and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from [[structured data]], while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines [[statistical analysis]], computational methods, and [[machine learning]] to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven [[decision-making]]. Both fields use data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.
